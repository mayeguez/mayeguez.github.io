descr: Awesome blog hosted on deta
tags: [general, awesome, blog]

In this blog post we are going to learn how to host a pseudo static/dynamic blog. The blog itself is from another developer who has a tutorial on how to make it, but for the sake of speed we are going to clone the repo and adapt it

This instruction are for linux only, but can be made in any os easily.

Make a folder wherever you want, open the terminal inside it and type

```bash
git clone https://github.com/insomnux/flaskblog.git
cd flaskblog
mv app.py main.py
```

If you want to follow the complete tutorial instead, go to
[flaskblog author post](https://nicolas.perriault.net/code/2012/dead-easy-yet-powerful-static-website-generator-with-flask/ "Author blog")


## Now let's install Deta cli

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.deta.dev/cli.sh | sh
```

check if deta cli installed sucesfully

```bash
deta --help
```

If you get error you must add the cli to your path

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/home/<user>/.deta/bin"
```

Check again 

```bash
deta --help

Usage:
  deta [flags]
  deta [command]

Available Commands:
  auth        Change auth settings for a deta micro
  clone       Clone a deta micro
  cron        Change cron settings for a deta micro
  deploy      Deploy a deta micro
  details     Details about a deta micro
  help        Help about any command
  login       Login to deta
  new         Create a new deta micro
  projects    List deta projects
  pull        Pull the lastest deployed code of a deta micro
  run         Run a deta micro
  update      Update a deta micro
  version     Print deta version
  visor       Change visor settings for a deta micro
  watch       Deploy changes in real time

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for deta

Use "deta [command] --help" for more information about a command.

```

### We are set

In terminal type
```bash
deta --login
```

Once logged in type
```bash
deta new
``` 

And finaly 
```bash
deta deploy
``` 

`Pro tip` Make sure you type those commands inside the project folder

Now go to [web.deta.sh](https://web.deta.sh "deta"), in micros tab, and look for the project, there is a link for your brand new blog

### Local develop

For ease on the customization, you should make changes locally

Lets create a virtual environment, activated and install dependencies

```bash
virtualenv env
. env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirments.txt
```

Finally run the server locally
```bash
python main.py
```

`Pro tip` Do not make the virtualenv inside de root folder of your project, thats because the virtualenv will be uploaded to the micros.

So here is a example of how i do it

```bash
mkdir dev && cd dev
virtualenv env
. env/bin/activate
git clone clone https://github.com/insomnux/flaskblog.git
cd flaskblog
pip install -r requirments.txt
mv app.py main.py
deta new
deta deploy
python main.py
```

#### Cheers

`BTW` this blog is made with de flaskblog and deta micros
